        <p>     My name is Seyha Soeurn, 19 years old. I’m from a small family in the countryside, Battambang Province. I am the second child in my family, I have a sister and a brother. My family was broken many years ago and my grandparents have brung me to an organization since I was young. I grew up with a simple life and sometimes it is hard to accept. I have never had time together with my family because my parents, they all have already had new families My name is Seyha Soeurn, 19 years old.

            Nowadays, I live in Phnom Penh City which is the capital of Cambodia. I’m a student at Passerelles Numeriques Cambodia (PNC). I’m studying Information Technology (IT), for I want to be a WEB Developer. I've been interested in Information Technology since I was studying in grade 11. I’m a lucky person because I can study at PNC. For my life in the city, I have lived with my organization that supports my studying since I was young. My feeling was surprising the first time I arrived in Phnom Penh, but it doesn’t mean I like the city, I dislike the city because I like living in the countryside. I like somewhere where nature, fresh and comfortable, nore is it necessary for my studying. Every day I’m still studying and I will try to study more and more to make my dream come true and succeed in my life. I have more plans when I graduate, I want to have a proper job that I can help myself and also my family. I love my grandmother the most. In my free time I like listening to music, going for a walk, researching, creating something new, communicating with my friends and so on. I hope my life goes better after I graduate. I’m not a good student because when I was studying in high school I alway studied just for passing and not to get a good grade Nowadays, I live in Phnom Penh City which is the capital of Cambodia.

            This is a summarizing history about myself. I’m a person who is less warm from my family and living alone. Many good things that's happened in my life, but still some hurtful things have happened that make me feel nothing. However, how my life fell, I have never given up, I always overcome it and go on, nothing challenge can kick off my intention. I was born with some bad destiny, but I will change my destiny to be better than This is a summarizing history about myself. I’m a person who is less warm from my family and living alone.
